# TheatreVertigoRentals
This project was my contribution to a website for a theater company, "Theatre Vertigo". My portion of the project included creating the Rental Portion of the site. I contributed to existing code base as a member of an Agile/Scrum development team.

In this project, I leveraged Entity Framework code first to scaffold a rental site with full CRUD functionality in an MVC application.
<br>
<br>
I began by creating a Rental Class:

<br>
In addition I created two additional classes that inherited from the Rental Class, one dealing with Equipment Rentals, and the other dealing with the Rental of physical spaces called RentalRoom :

Once this was completed the pages were scaffolded with full CRUD functionality.
 The pages were styled using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to meet company standards.
